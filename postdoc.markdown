Postdoctoral research associate positions in RIRO Lab
======

We are looking for highly motivated postdocs to join the Robust Intelligence and Robotics Lab.

### Position Summary
The position is at the Robust Intelligence and Robotics Lab at the school of computing, KAIST. The lab is currently composed of a professor, graduate/undergrad students, visiting scholars, and secretarial support. The RIRO lab aims to empower robots to be trusted collaborators in every part of our society by introducing novel learning, reasoning, and execution capabilities. We are particularly focusing on the development of collaborative mobile manipulation system with learning, planning, and communication capabilities. We have excellent facilities including a human-size mobile manipulator, small mobile manipulators, human-like dexterous hands, haptic gloves, etc. We also have strong collaborations with many domestic/international groups. 


We are looking for post-doctoral researchers who can work on some of the followings, but not limited to:
- Mobile manipulations
- Task or task-and-motion planning algorithms for mobile manipulation
- (Inverse) reinforcement learning framework for in-hand manipulation
- Multi-agent system or natural-language-driven mobile manipulation system
- Design, implementation, and evaluation of algorithms on our experimental platforms
You will be supported by multiple graduate students with more focus on the design of algorithm and implementation. Please check our website.

### YOUR PROFILE
In order to be successful in this position you will need to have:
- PhD in Robotics, AI, or closely related field
- Good academic track record with publications
- Strong background in one of the following: Planning, Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Control
- Good English skills, written and spoken
- Good skills in Python, Deep Learning / Reinforcement Learning Programming (e.g., PyTorch and/or Tensorflow, etc.) and Linux
- Experties in working with real robot systems is a big plus 

The following qualifications would be an advantage:

# We are looking for highly motivated undergrad interns for this summer of 2024.

## Potential topics for Undergrads
- Large-language model-based mobile manipulation
- Constraint-based Quadruped robot navigation
- Deformable object manipulation via reinforcement learning (RL)
- Inverse constraint learning (inverse reinforcement learning)


After building the above systems, you will be asked to control it by applying reinforcement learning, end-to-end learning, probabilistic movement primitives, etc. 

## Application Process for URP and Internships 
1. Fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fbOFI3ML3-3dVU44x4nC6wAQklnbhPCmnANIR2IJSFc/viewform?gxids=7628&edit_requested=true"> <U>pre-interview form</U></a>. If you are qualified, you will get a response within 2 weeks.
2. Get an interview with Dr. Park.
3. You can then join our lab.

### Note
- We are looking for domestic undergrads only at this moment. 
- We will provide a desk and a computer.
- Internship students will be paid during Summer and Winter vacations.


## Application Process for individual studies (KAIST undergrad only)
(Due to too many e-mails, Prof. Park may not be able to respond individually. So, kindly complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fbOFI3ML3-3dVU44x4nC6wAQklnbhPCmnANIR2IJSFc/viewform?gxids=7628&edit_requested=true"> <U>pre-interview form</U></a>. If a slot is available, you can expect a response within 2 weeks.) 

We welcome any students looking to explore this Robotics area. Please, send a contact e-mail to <daehyung@kaist.ac.kr> with your CV and transcript. 

### Note
You will be able to get a desk and/or a computer. You can freely access our robots, too!

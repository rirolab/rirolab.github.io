We are looking for highly motivated undergrad researchers, particularly for this winter 2021.

## Potential topics for Undergrads
- Natural-language grounding for mobile manipulation
- Quadruped robot integration for SLAM
- Deformable object manipulation via RL
- Inverse constraint learning
- Visually-guided tactile manipulation

After building the above systems, you will be asked to control it by applying reinforcement learning, end-to-end learning, probabilistic movement primitives, etc. 

## Application Process for URP and Internships 
1. Fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fbOFI3ML3-3dVU44x4nC6wAQklnbhPCmnANIR2IJSFc/viewform?gxids=7628&edit_requested=true"> <U>pre-interview form</U></a>. If you are qualified, you will get a contact within 2 weeks.
